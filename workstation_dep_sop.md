4.	What does the author emphasize regarding the audience when writing SOPs, and why is it essential to consider them?
To keep it clear and concise to avoid confusion, made portable so changes can be implemented, flowcharts that easily digestible, consistency so the standard is met every time, and the audience which needs to understand what the SOP is telling them without confusion.

5.	Imagine you are a part of a multicultural team responsible for following an SOP. How would you address potential misunderstandings or differing interpretations of the procedure due to cultural differences? Propose strategies to foster effective cross-cultural communication.
To address this I would ensure the language is appropriate do that everyone can understand, have visual aids to assist with language barriers, cultural awareness so we can be sure we donâ€™t offend another person, and active listening to understand a team members insights and suggestions.
