1. What role does the help desk professional play within an organization, particularly in relation to customers?
A help desk professional has the responsibility of providing technical support to the organizations employees when they encounter issues with IT systems. This includes identifying and diagnosing problems, proposing a solution and appropriate course of action, and escalating to a higher support level if required.

2. The article differentiates between hard and soft skills. In your culture or community, are there specific skills that are highly valued? How do they compare to the skills mentioned in the article?
When I was in the military hard skills were important so you can do the job you trained for effectively. However, soft skills played a bigger role because teamwork, communication, critical thinking, and problem solving often made the difference between success and failure

3. Why have security skills become more important in recent years for help desk technicians?
Security threats have evolved and continue to evolve into more and more significant threats toward people and organizations. Having techs that have the basic skills to recognize and identify the threats can help resolve the problem. For higher level problems, the help desk professionals can then forward these possible breaches to the infosec team to further investigate the issue.

4. How do writing skills and critical thinking skills play a vital role in the work of help desk technicians?
Writing skills are important because they allow the help desk tech to effectively communicate throughout the organization and its customers. This requires the tech to have the ability to write in a manner that allows those who have little technical knowledge to easily understand what is being communicated. 
Critical thinking skills help resolve problems by comparing current problems to past problems. This allows these problems to be resolved quickly. This experience can then use this experience to troubleshoot and solve more complex problems.
