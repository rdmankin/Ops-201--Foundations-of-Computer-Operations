###Reading 02 - What is Bash?

What is Bash?

1.	What is the primary function of a shell in a computer’s operating system?
It allows users to operate the operating system outside of the kernel.

2.	How does Bash locate and execute commands on a Linux or Unix system?
When you issue a command to Bash, it scans the directories to determine if a command can be executed. The following command is used to commands are located on the system : $ which bash/usr/bin/bash $ which ls /usr/bin/ls

3.	How can you determine if your system is running a Bash shell?
You can determine this by using the echo command: $ echo $0 bash.

4.	What makes Bash scripting powerful and why is it considered scriptable?
It’s powerful because it saves you time through automation and its very user friendly. You can avoid performing repetitive tasks because Bash does it for you.

5.	Bash scripting allows for customization, automation, and efficiency. Discuss methods or practices from your previous work experience or cultural background that aim to achieve similar goals in daily tasks.
In my experience a tank crewman in the Army, we used to have to boresight (enter data to make the tank shoot accurately) the tank manually. A couple of years later the upgrades to the system included some automations of the system, such as self-correcting software.
