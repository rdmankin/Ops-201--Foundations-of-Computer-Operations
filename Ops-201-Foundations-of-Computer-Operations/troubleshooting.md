### Reading 04 - Issue Tracking System


1.	What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?
An appropriate course of action would be to break the problems up individually and use the troubleshooting process with each of those problems. 

2.	What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?
Use the preferred testing method of verifying the problem has been resolved.

3.	What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?
You can create and/or add to a database the can be referenced in the future to have a solution to a particular problem,

4.	Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background?
In my community, people, including myself value surveillance cameras on our homes and with that we value safety and security. When going through the troubleshooting process, you can consider the end-users preferences by asking them how they would like the system to operate like, bigger fonts for control panels, volume settings, a chart to follow so they can try to fix the problem before needing to spend money for a tech.
