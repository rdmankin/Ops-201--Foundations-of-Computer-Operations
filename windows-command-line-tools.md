3.	What advantages does the “robocopy” command offer over the “xcopy” command, and why is it useful for file transfers in certain situations?

4.	Think about any real-life scenarios from your cultural context where the use of command line tools could be beneficial. Describe one such scenario and explain how a specific command line tool would help address the situation.
