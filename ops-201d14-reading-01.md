1.	What is the purpose of the Windows System Restore tool?
This is a tool that allows the Windows Operating system to create and manage restore points. I like to think of it the same as undoing a previous command in word for example.

2.	How long does it usually take to use the System Restore tool in Windows?
It takes anywhere from 10-30 minutes.

4.	What options are available if System Restore did not fix the problem?
The options are to repeat the restore process or continuing to troubleshoot the problem.
